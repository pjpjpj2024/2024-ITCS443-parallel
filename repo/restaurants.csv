Signature menu: Chicken rice.
Spacious parking lot, many menus to choose from. At noon, there are a lot of people. The chicken rice is delicious. The fried chicken is a bit dry, so it's a bit hard. But everything else is delicious, especially the stuffed dessert and the steamed cup cake. Very delicious. The coconut milk is rich, fragrant, sweet, and creamy. The staff provides good service.

Signature menu: Duck and red pork wonton noodles.
I like that there is a parking lot behind the shop. Today I was hungry on the way home, so I stopped to try it. There were quite a few people in the shop. I ordered dry wonton noodles (duck + roast pork). It was delicious, especially the wontons. The noodles were just okay. The duck and roast pork were cut into large pieces. The stewed bitter melon with mushrooms was soft. I guess since I'm old, I ate it and the bitter melon wasn't bitter at all. It was actually sweet. I was full for another meal.

A Thai restaurant that doesn't have very strong flavors. It's suitable for bringing foreign friends to taste Thai food. The flavors are pleasing to foreigners, but Thais can eat it just fine.

I had a Gin & Tonic made with gin infused with blackberry & raspberry, mixed with holy tonic water. It felt divine and tasted fantastic.
I loved that the bartender even cut new ice cubes, saying smaller cubes melt too fast, and expensive gin shouldn‚Äôt be watered down ü§£.

Chopkeeper Butcher & Tap was the choice for a Valentine‚Äôs Dinner with my beloved. This Western restaurant with fresh beer is located in Soi Pattanakarn 44 in front of The Connect Village. It‚Äôs a single-unit shop, not very big, with a warm atmosphere and a variety of food menus to choose from.
The US beef steak is vacuum-packed and made into a soft steak, topped with delicious gravy and mashed potatoes. I like the fried squid tentacles, crispy and flavorful, squeezed with lemon, and dipped in cream sauce‚Äîdelicious.

Crispy pork is the best.
Price per person: less than 100 baht.
Signature menu: Bitter melon stewed with pork ribs (small), Crispy pork rice (special).
I came to meet customers in this area. I had read reviews of this restaurant many times but never had a chance to stop by. The last time I intended to eat here, the restaurant was closed. Today was a good opportunity, as the restaurant was open, so I got to try it. The restaurant is located on the side of Phatthanakan Road, but parking isn‚Äôt an issue as there‚Äôs plenty of parking behind the restaurant. The restaurant is clean and tidy, comfortable to sit and eat, although it‚Äôs a little hot, but the fan helps. I ordered special red pork and crispy pork rice for 70 baht with egg and Chinese sausage to try first.

Reviewer 2:
Crispy pork rice that is incredibly delicious.
Price per person: less than 100 baht.
Back at the hotel area, I was looking for dinner and decided to try this restaurant. Returning to Thai style, I ordered red pork and crispy pork rice. At first, I didn‚Äôt expect much, but I found the rice fragrant and soft, the soup delicious, and the crispy pork really crispy. Eating it with spring onions was great. The price, if I remember correctly, was 50 baht, which was very good value.

Red pork, crispy pork, Uncle Lai, I like Uncle Lai‚Äôs shop ^^
Price per person: less than 100 baht.
Signature dishes: Bitter melon stew with pork ribs, Crispy pork, Fried pork with garlic.
This is another restaurant I often come to because it‚Äôs near my old workplace. I walk here during the day, and most importantly, it‚Äôs delicious. Even though my house is far away, I‚Äôll come back to eat if I have the chance. The restaurant is located on the side of Phatthanakan Road, a little past Soi Phatthanakan 46, before reaching Thawarawadi. One disadvantage is that there is no parking. I recommend parking in Soi 46 and walking to the restaurant. The restaurant is a single-room shophouse, not decorated much, with an old atmosphere. There‚Äôs even a picture of an old Sprite advertisement on display.

Din Tai Fung is the place for Xiao Long Bao. The thin dough is stuffed with minced pork, and when you bite into it, the sweet soup with minced pork flavor flows out‚Äîit's delicious. The noodles at the shop are also freshly kneaded and tasty. Xiao Long Bao comes in two sizes: 5 pieces for 199 baht and 8 pieces for 249 baht. It has many flavors, including pork, crab, vegetables, and chicken, but my favorite is pork. The dough is thin, the pork is soft, and the pork soup inside is very fragrant.

Signature dishes: Stir-fried Chinese cabbage, Bell peppers stuffed with minced pork, Cold seaweed salad.
There were two of us. We went on a weekday at noon, and there weren't many people, so we didn‚Äôt have to wait long for our food. The Szechuan Soup Noodles were sour, and the noodles were good, though not my favorite. The Crab Xiao Long Bao was enjoyed by my companion, though I didn‚Äôt like the smell of crab. The Bell Peppers Stuffed with Minced Pork were incredibly delicious and my favorite dish. The Stir-Fried Chinese Cabbage with Garlic was light and satisfying. The Cold Seaweed Salad made for a great appetizer. The total price was about 1,200 baht, which is quite expensive, but it‚Äôs worth indulging every now and then.

Dine on vegetarian dishes and delicious desserts at Greyhound. Let‚Äôs stop by to try the vegetarian menu at Greyhound Siam Center. The shop is on the 1st floor, next to Siam Discovery. The atmosphere is quiet and not crowded. Menu ordered: ~ Sweet corn soup, roasted pumpkin and tofu salad, bruschetta with tomato and mushroom, stir-fried penne with mushrooms and tofu in pesto sauce, steamed dumpling ice cream. The food tastes good as usual. The dishes are large and generously portioned. What impressed me most was the steamed dumpling ice cream, one of the new dessert menu items.

Haidilao Hot Pot, ""Haidilao"" Central World Isetan 7th floor. Review during the new city unlock period, not long to wait, and there are seats with proper distancing. No special service before eating, but once your turn comes, you can go anywhere. There is a QR code to track the queue number. The staff provides excellent service, always checking if anything is missing and recommending menus. The staff prepares meatball sauce and scoops clear soup for you to try. There is a wireless charger and USB port at the table, but neither worked on the day I visited. A plastic bag is provided to protect your phone from water.

The menu includes five types of soup: Mala soup with chili flakes, spicier than normal with Sichuan pepper, Mala soup without chili flakes, less spicy but very oily, Three-friend soup hot pot with chicken oil, cucumber, wolfberry, and mushrooms, which was very bland, Tomato soup hot pot, sweet and well-rounded, and Mushroom soup hot pot with enoki mushrooms, which was basic. There is also Tom Yum soup hot pot with shrimp, which is mild but delicious. The dipping sauce costs 45 baht per person, and you can refill as much as you want. The options include Mala flavor, Sesame soy sauce, sweet Sesame sauce, and salty Seafood sauce.

Food ordered included fish, which was not fresh, pork, which was thinly sliced and tasted good, tofu skin, which was ordinary, and vegetables and mushrooms, which were also ordinary. Fried chicken was oily and not delicious, steamed dumplings were hard and flavorless, and the sour and spicy noodle salad was sour, salty, and of average quality. Overall, the taste was ordinary, and the restaurant is not recommended. The food was not outstanding, and the quality seemed to have decreased, possibly due to COVID. Additional services were also not available. However, for a colorful and unique shabu experience, it might be worth visiting.

Reviewer 2:
It is a Chinese Shabu restaurant that impresses with its presentation style. The staff are well-trained and provide excellent service, deserving five stars. As for the food, I give it four stars. The presentation is a mix of a la carte and buffet. The buffet includes desserts, drinks, ice cream, and side dishes, which alone make up nearly half the value of the price. The overall experience is worth the cost. The restaurant also offers special services like nail care and a pattern of staff providing massages, which adds to the experience. The food is fresh and of good quality.

Reviewer 3:
Personally, I am not a fan of Mala. I have tried Mala-flavored snacks before and found them unappetizing. I had seen reviews of famous conveyor belt restaurants that seemed unappealing, with dirty ingredients and lackluster presentation. Over time, the trend of Mala restaurants faded, leaving many of them feeling lonely. I decided to try it once as a way to experience something new. I believe that the first time you try a particular type of food significantly affects your impression and determines whether you will continue to enjoy it in the future.

Crab fried rice made by Grandpa 100 years ago may not have the smoky wok aroma, but I personally enjoy its mild taste and light fragrance. The rice isn‚Äôt too dry, and at 450 baht, it seems expensive but serves two people with a generous amount of crab. Water mimosa with seafood is decent, though I wish it were fried drier and more fragrant; overall, it‚Äôs acceptable. Grilled shrimp promotion 168 features fresh and bouncy shrimp, though they are slightly oily.

Jay Fai Pratu Phi. Jay Fai Pratu Phi restaurant is known for its crab omelet, which is packed full of crab meat, allowing you to eat to your heart‚Äôs content. Alongside the crab omelet, there are many other delicious seafood menus. This time, I tried the fried shrimp with garlic. The shrimp are big, with firm meat, and are fried with garlic, making them very tasty. The stir-fried seafood with soy sauce is also impressive, filled with soft, chewy noodles and lots of seafood. The taste is well-rounded, delicious, and truly awesome.

Reviewer 2:
This shop is impossible not to know. It has been featured in the media countless times as a famous street food spot in Thailand. The most famous dish is the crab omelet, which is packed with crab meat and sells for about 800 baht per plate. ü¶Ä Jay Fai‚Äôs shop does not have air conditioning, but her cooking skills are nothing short of excellent.

Anyone looking for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant with a delicate taste that is not too strong, I recommend this restaurant. The shop is beautiful, the colors of the lamps make you think of the atmosphere of a chic shop/cafe in Vietnam. The fried spring rolls at this restaurant are really delicious. The grilled pork with betel leaves is very fragrant. Bun cha, which is fresh rice noodles with honey grilled pork, also has the restaurant's signature fried spring rolls. To finish, the coffee pudding is a great palate cleanser.

This hotel is a hotel with a famous Italian restaurant called Spasso. It is a restaurant that my family took me to often when I was a child. Now it is gone and has been replaced by this restaurant. The atmosphere has changed from a restaurant, a semi-Italian restaurant, a pub to a genuine Italian restaurant, comfortable but still luxurious according to the hotel's characteristics. Good children, this restaurant has an Italian menu. For those who want to eat meat, there is a steak that is quite delicious. For dessert, you must end with Tiramisu.

It is considered a favorite southern restaurant because the southern flavors are not afraid of anyone.

I recommend it, you must order it! ‚Ä¢ Stir-fried minced pork with fresh vegetables, the restaurant's signature menu, very well made, the curry paste is clear, dry curry, eaten with fresh vegetables, this is the number one menu. ‚Ä¢ Yellow curry with coconut shoots and sea bass, fresh sea bass, large pieces, spicy and sour curry.

Spicy, eye-catching, and Michelin-starred, with a top-notch Thai dish, ""Stir-fried Minced Pork with Red Curry"", which is the restaurant's recommended dish. They even used the name of this dish as the restaurant's Thai-style name. ‚Ä¢ When I walked past, I thought it was a dessert shop because the colors looked more like a dessert shop than a fancy restaurant selling Thai food. ‚Ä¢ The service is at the level of a hotel. ‚Ä¢ The price is very high, not economical at all, plus ++ another 10+7 on top of that. ‚Ä¢ That's why the recommended dish and the dessert in the cup.

Today I came to try two more collaboration menus that I didn't order last week: milk tea and ice cream. The milk tea was normal, but the ice cream was great. The ice cream was smooth, the pudding was smooth and delicious. If I have to criticize, it would be that there were too few and the macarons were too sweet. As for the sushi, well, I think the quality of the food at this branch is better than the Seacon branch. The rice is more sour and the rice balls are firmer when compared to the Seacon girls. #WongnaiJapaneseSpecialist #SushiSpecialist.

Kaiseki with tofu menu highlights
Price per person: more than 1,000 baht
Umenohana: I haven't been to this restaurant in many years. I only went there often when it first opened (I know how many years, lol). This restaurant is good at various tofu dishes and focuses on serving Kaiseki set meals. Overall, the prices are a bit high. Today, we ordered food because we were hungry, so we had little self-control. We didn't look at our eating ability at all. Everything we ordered was as follows: ) ‚Ä¢ Hikiage Yuba: fresh tofu skin that we made ourselves at the table.",https://kiji.life/eats/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Umenohana.jpg

Price per person: 501 - 1,000 baht. Signature dishes: Tiramisu, Burrata Cheese, Pizza Burrata. Whether it's savory or sweet, the food here is delicious and authentic Italian. Soft, fragrant cheese makes every dish special. The pizza comes with an option for half-and-half toppings, and the baked mussels are fantastic. Ideal for special occasions or birthday celebrations. A great spot to satisfy your longing for Europe!

Reviewer 2: 
Italian food in the Sathorn area is a must-try! Antipasti like Fritto misto (fried shrimp and squid) are delicious, served with lemon and tartar sauce. The dough is thin and not oily. The Parma e Burrata pizza, famous at this place, was a bit too crispy this time, lacking its usual softness. Still a good choice overall.

Reviewer 3: 
Price per person: 251 - 500 baht. Signature dishes: MARGHERITA, Pancetta Parmigiano e Noci, AGLIO e OLIO. Ordered delivery from Via Emilia via the Lineman app. It arrived quickly, within half an hour, and the unique Italian flavors didn't disappoint. However, they often forget to include cutlery. Prices are reasonable compared to similar restaurants in the area.

Reviewer 4: 
This restaurant offers home-cooked Italian cuisine from the Emilia-Romagna region, known for high-quality ingredients like Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto di Parma. The atmosphere is cute, and they even allow dogs in the outside seating area. The place is popular, so reservations are recommended. Street parking is available, and staff will assist with parking directions.",https://bk.asia-city.com/sites/default/files/u143727/via_emilia_tagliolini.jpg

Price per person: 251 - 500 baht. Favourites: Grilled pork neck on a hot plate. The restaurant along the Ram Intra Expressway has expanded and improved, with ample parking and a deeper seating area. Despite the changes, I still prefer the water-side seats near the entrance. Ordered stir-fried morning glory, butter-baked scallops, grilled pork neck on a hot plate, and steamed sea bass with soybeans. All were delicious, though the Japanese menu was disappointing.

Reviewer 2: 
Price per person: 501 - 1,000 baht. Favourites: Fried German Pork Leg, Sour curry with crab eggs and pickled bamboo shoots. Always a must-visit! The sour curry with crab eggs and pickled bamboo shoots (around 450 - 550 baht) was unexpectedly delicious, perfect for waking up or curing a hangover. The crab is generously filled with eggs, and the bamboo shoots add a satisfying sourness. The fried German pork leg (390 baht) is pre-cut and very tasty. Highly recommended!

Reviewer 3: 
Spent 8 hours singing karaoke with friends, and the room fee split came to just 100 baht per person. Weekdays are more fun than festivals, and there are plenty of promotions like 50% off the karaoke room fee from Sunday to Thursday. Great for long hangouts, with delicious food and live music. A favorite spot since my junior high school days!

Reviewer 2:
You & I Buffet is a sukiyaki shabu buffet restaurant that has a variety of soups to choose from, including clear soup, black soup, mala soup, shark fin soup, and many more. The buffet has many prices, starting at the cheapest at 498+. We chose to eat the premium buffet course 698+ because we wanted to eat a wider variety of beef, including Wagyu beef, Angus beef, Kurobuta pork, stuffed with various cheeses. There are also seafood menus with shrimp, shellfish, fish, and a variety of dipping sauces to choose from, snacks, desserts.

Reviewer 3:
ü•©Today, I made an appointment with my friends to eat at You&I at the Mega Bangna branch. We chose Course 698+. We could choose 2 soup bases. Our favorite menu is the Wagyu beef.

Price per person: 251 - 500 baht. Signature menu: Sour curry. During the vegetarian period, there are vegetarian options available with strong southern flavors. Crispy pork is tasty but should be eaten quickly before it loses its crispiness. This Thai restaurant and sweet cafe by Pla (iberry) offers 'Homemade' quality food. Despite being pricey, the taste and service make it worth it.

Reviewer 2:
I've become addicted to the flavor of Thai food here! 'Kap Khao Kap Pla' restaurant comes from a passion for homemade cooking and desserts. Today's menu highlights include crispy crabmeat spring rolls (450‡∏ø), pomelo salad with crispy shrimp (230‡∏ø), and the must-try sour curry with cha-om and fried eggs (335‡∏ø).

Price per person: more than 1,000 baht
Signature dishes: Curry crab, Tom Yum Kung, Shrimp Miang, German pork leg, Grilled jumbo prawns
It was a coincidence that we came to the restaurant because it was far from our accommodation. But I must say that you should really come to this restaurant at least once. - The atmosphere of the restaurant The atmosphere of the restaurant is very good. Listen to music, eat food, look at the view. Everything is very good, everyone. Most importantly, there are no mosquitoes to bother the outdoor zone. We chose to sit in the outdoor zone by the river. Eat food and look at the bridge. It really lives up to the name of the restaurant. - The staff The staff at this restaurant are very cute. They are kind, have good manners, and give good advice. They are cheerful and friendly. - The taste of the food Overall, we think the taste of the food is very good. For the taste of the food, we give it 4/5.

Enjoy the breeze and see Rama VIII Bridge
Price per person: 251 - 500 baht
Signature dishes: Oysters, morning glory noodles, butter-baked scallops
This is another restaurant that I can say has a very good atmosphere. It is a restaurant where we can sit and eat while enjoying the view of the Chao Phraya River. There is both an indoor zone that is an air-conditioned room, wooden folding doors with glass in a vintage style, and an outdoor zone where you can sit and enjoy the breeze and chill along the Chao Phraya River. And for those who choose the outdoor zone, the taste of the food is delicious, just go to every menu. As for the seafood, it is fresh. Anyone looking for a place to socialize or celebrate a special occasion this place is reccommended!!! <3

Spicy southern food. Kamin Camin Cuisine & Cafe at Central World is beautifully decorated, blending modern and local styles with warm tones. Signature southern dishes include rich stir-fried shrimp with stink beans and fresh sea bass in sour curry with young coconut shoots, both ideal with steamed rice. The Kai Kor Lae chicken is marinated to a soft texture, while the fried pork belly with fish sauce and dipping sauce is delicious.

Reviewer 2: 
Try southern food at a famous restaurant. The restaurant has a beautiful decor and comfortable seating, though the Central World branch is smaller than the main Kaset-Nawamin branch. The lighting and atmosphere are inviting. However, I found the food to be quite salty, with flavors that, while good, didn‚Äôt stand out as much as expected.

Reviewer 3: 
Southern restaurant with strong flavors. This southern restaurant brings authentic local flavors to Bangkok, now with several branches. Kai Kor Lae and dishes with shrimp paste are especially aromatic and flavorful. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, but prices are high, reflecting the quality ingredients and ambiance in shopping mall locations.

The roast pork is as delicious as its reputation. Good atmosphere restaurant near Kaset Nawamin. You can drive here following the GPS. If you go there by yourself, you might get lost. This restaurant has a good atmosphere and parking available. You have to order the roast pork in advance for 3,500 baht. Right now, there is a promotion with a free bottle of Sparkling Wine. It's worth it. It's really delicious. You can eat it all without any bones getting in the way. It tastes good. There are 3 kinds of dipping sauces. It's worth it. The traditional glass noodle salad tastes good. The price is high according to the place. It's delicious, but a little small. The three friends have roast pork, crispy pork, and duck. This dish is delicious.

AS YOU WISH. Price per person: more than 1,000 baht. Review !!!! AS YOU WISH Eat by yourself, pay by yourself Mom Thanat Daek, 3,500 baht per set!! Omg!! Consists of 1 whole roast pig, a set of bread with crispy potato chips, vegetable salad, 3 flavors of dipping sauce. The first bite (crunch!!) Oh my!! Very crispy. When you chew it, you will know why it takes so long to prepare. It's so delicious that you don't even need to dip it. It's as delicious as its reputation. I highly recommend it. If you want to try it once, take your family and friends to eat it.

Reviewer 3: 
""Roast pigs can fly,"" said Mom Thanat Daek. Price per person: 501 - 1,000 baht. Signature menu: Roasted black pork (premium recipe) with crispy golden skin and tender, juicy meat. I saw this restaurant on YouTube. I saw Mom Thanat Daek promote it quite heavily, so I decided to give it a try. The roast pork is quite expensive, about 4,500 baht per kilogram. I personally think the taste is delicious. There are many other dishes to choose from, mostly fusion style. Prices range from medium to expensive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite good, suitable for families. If you come in the evening, it should be very chill. The restaurant is a bit far from the city. #We recommend this app.

Reviewer 4: 
Fusion menu, good idea. Price per person: 251 - 500 baht. Signature menu: Roasted black pork (premium recipe) with crispy golden skin and tender, juicy meat. It's a Thai fusion restaurant. Each menu is designed with an unusual twist. Each menu is presented and detailed. The roasted black pork (premium recipe) has crispy, fluffy skin. They provide dry ice to make smoke when serving the roast pork. It's a cool idea. The food isn't very spicy. Some dishes are a little spicy. The restaurant is suitable for coming in the evening because it's very hot during the day. Even though the restaurant has air conditioning, it's still hot. The restaurant also accepts advance table reservations. #WongnaiHNY2023.

Along the Chao Phraya River, nice atmosphere
Price per person: more than 1,000 baht
Signature menu: Jumbo crab meat stir-fried with curry paste and betel leaves, river prawns with chili and salt
Have passed by Tha Maharaj many times but never tried it. The restaurant has both air-conditioned and outdoor areas by the water. The atmosphere is quite nice. The menu is Thai style with quite a lot to choose from. - River prawn with chili and salt. The prawns are quite large, fresh and firm. The sauce is creamy and delicious when eaten with rice. - Crab meat with curry paste and betel leaves. The crab is quite fresh. The curry paste is a bit too salty and not very spicy. I would like it to be spicier. - Surat Thani oysters. Large, fresh oysters but I don't like the fact that they are topped with ice.

Still confirming that the food here is good.
Price per person: 251 - 500 baht
Signature dishes: Fried sea bass with fish sauce, Pineapple fried rice, Lemon chicken, Squid fried with salted eggs, Winged bean salad
Good or not, look at the picture. The crab claw meat that is baked with glass noodles is very big, already peeled, when you put it down, the smell of crab meat is super strong. You want to scoop the sauce and put it in your mouth to know once and for all. The lobster is also wow. Very big, very fragrant with butter. Split the back according to the custom. The meat is soft and fluffy. Oh, it melts. Don't let anyone eat it. Let me take a picture first. Pineapple fried rice. Baked in a pineapple. Very fragrant. Plenty of mango seeds. Every bite is delicious. Fried sun-dried squid. Looks ordinary but not ordinary.",https://www.ryoiireview.com/upload/editor_review/202009/1600754450_f5b53b0bb77fa27d62dc54aeccc323b5.jpg

Price per person: 101 - 250 baht. Hua Seng Hong, Charoen Krung 14 branch, is perfect for those wanting to enjoy delicious Chinatown-style food without the hassle of finding parking. The atmosphere feels just like Yaowarat. They offer a wide selection of dishes, including morning glory noodles and assorted dim sum, making it a convenient one-stop for Chinese cuisine.

Reviewer 2: 
Price per person: 101 - 250 baht. Hua Seng Hong Restaurant offers a wide variety of Chinese dishes, from single plates to dim sum. I tried the ha kao, fried taro, and Hong Kong fried noodles, which were quite tasty, but the restaurant was a bit chaotic due to the crowd. Be aware that there is no parking at this branch.

Reviewer 3: 
Price per person: 501 - 1,000 baht. Hua Seng Hong has been a well-known Chinese restaurant since 1956, with numerous branches across Bangkok. Today, I enjoyed dishes like fish maw in red gravy, Hong Kong fried noodles, stir-fried Chinese kale with oyster sauce, and steamed sea bass in soy sauce. Everything was flavorful, and I recommend stopping by if you‚Äôre ever in Yaowarat.",https://i0.wp.com/sinehabangkok.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/HuaSengHong-Iconsiam-SinehaBangkok-2.webp?resize=810%2C1080&ssl=1
